Resources and Readings
---

All resources and readings are optional. I firmly believe that everyone learns in different ways that may change over time.
For some people, reading is a fantastic approach. For others, reading can be tiresome and ineffective. Sometimes those roles can reverse.
The same concept can apply to most mediums, so this page will include various resources that you may find helpful.

I recommend skimming most resources to start, referring back to them later if you find a topic you want to learn more about.
