This is a soap dispenser. It dispenses soap without touching the dispenser.

Resistant bacteria can spread, despite the immediate hand washing, this prevents that. This is especially useful in hospitals.

**What an innovation!** What is the problem with this?

# It's racist!

Well, it's not racist, but it was clearly made by a team who _only tested it on light skin_.

![legend:Spacesuit height:400px](./img/diversity/spacesuit.jpg)

The space suit is an engineering marvel. Allowing a human to survive in the vacuum of space, it allows us to take a step where no man has gone before.

## Why only men?

**Because space suits don't fit women**

Anne McClain is an astronaut that had to give up her seat on a mission into space because there was not enough space suits at NASA to fit _two_ women at once.

# Diversity & Inclusion

Workplaces that are not diverse & inclusive can have detrimental effects on your products, create discriminatory environments, and have effects such as hand soap dispensers not working and career opportunities being suppressed (spacesuit incident).

# Diversity & Inclusion

On the other hand, they can literally _kill_ people.

Let's explore and discuss this topic in more depth.

# Diversity & Inclusion

Cars in the mid 20th century were designed for the 50th percentile of men. This means that cars were unsafe for women (and especially pregnant women).

It wasn't until **2011** that companies started testing with female-sized crash test dummies. Many vehicles still aren't as safe due to decades-established prejudice design practices.

# Diversity & Inclusion

Other examples of potential problems include:

- AI being trained on men
    - AI robots used for operations in hospitals couldn't respond to a woman's voice
    - Hello Barbie! Barbie doll couldn't respond to a child's voice
- Google's Image labelling AI labelled black people as gorillas
- Apple Health Kit failed to include a feature for ~50% of the population until iOS 9... period tracking
    - They finally added it to Apple Watch in 2019

# Diversity & Inclusion

Other examples of potential problems include:

- YouTube, when it first started, had an issue where 5-10% of their videos were uploaded upside down due to left handed users
    - Their team was mostly right-handed people
- In the 1950s, Kodak developed a colour calibration card with a white woman
    - Took until the 1970s until the realized it had an impact on dark-skinned users
    - Took until the 1990s to address the issue

# Diversity & Inclusion

So why can't we just train the people we have to understand these issues?

- When white men were presented with a crowd of people that was 17% women, they thought it was an even 50/50 split
   - When it was 33% women, they thought it was majority female
   - This is a good example of how it's hard to sympathize and see another's perspective

# Diversity & Inclusion

So why can't we just train the people we have to understand these issues?

- Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity outperform competitors by 15%
   - Companies with ethnic diversity outperform by 35%
- Studies have found that diverse work forces:
    - are 10x more effective
    - are 9x more innovative
    - provide 5x better customer service

---

# Diversity & Inclusion

Why is that?

- Multiple viewpoints lead to more innovations
- First hand experience is better than conceptual teachings, which leads to more culturally aware products
