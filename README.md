## Course Overview

Students will write a software application that implements the business ideas developed in
CSC454/2526 (Business of Software). This course will expose students to the core technologies, ideas, and processes in developing a startup.

Students will be given a theme in which to develop a startup. Students are expected to:
- Define their own scope of problem within the theme
- Develop a cohesive plan
- Produce a working MVP (minimum viable product)
- Present their work in various mediums, including written, orally, visually, and through the internet.

Class time will be a mixture of project-focused workshops, lectures, and discussions. The class will be small and very
interactive. Students may hear from guest lecturers from the field.
