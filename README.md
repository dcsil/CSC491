## Course Overview

Students will write a software application that implements the business ideas developed in
CSC454/2526 (Business of Software). This course will expose students to the core technologies, ideas, and processes in developing a startup.

Students will be given a theme, in the corequisite course (CSC454), in which to develop a startup. Students are expected to:
- Define their own scope of problem within the theme
- Develop a cohesive plan
- Produce a working MVP (minimum viable product)
- Present their work in various mediums, including written, orally, visually, and through the internet.

Class time will be a mixture of project-focused workshops, lectures, and discussions. The class will be small and very
interactive. Students may hear from guest lecturers from the field.

### Requirements to take this course

There is a co-requisite to CSC491/2600, students must also be enrolled in CSC454/2527 or have taken CSC454/2527 before to take this course.

### Required Materials/Software

There aren't any _required_ materials persay, but it is highly recommended to bring a laptop to class with a fully functioning developer environment for your project. While not all classes will be workshops, it is recommended to bring your laptop during each class for other uses such as research.

You will also need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

It is **required** to download, install, and set up [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) as this will be used for all communications throughout the term.

## Lecturer

Hello! My name is Julian Nadeau. You can reach me at julian.nadeau[at]utoronto.ca.

I am a Staff Software Developer at Stripe during the day. I've also worked in the startup space quite a lot having experienced explosive growth in various roles at GitHub (2019-2021) and Shopify (2013-2019, including their IPO).

I've run a not-for-profit startup as well, called Code For Kids, that helped teach kids how to code.
