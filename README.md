## Course Overview

Students will write a software application that implements the business ideas developed in
CSC454/2526 (Business of Software). This course will expose students to the core technologies, ideas, and processes in developing a startup.

Students will be given a theme in which to develop a startup. Students are expected to:
- Define their own scope of problem within the theme
- Develop a cohesive plan
- Produce a working MVP (minimum viable product)
- Present their work in various mediums, including written, orally, visually, and through the internet.

Class time will be a mixture of project-focused workshops, lectures, and discussions. The class will be small and very
interactive. Students may hear from guest lecturers from the field.

### Requirements to take this course

There is a co-requisite to CSC491/2601, students must also be enrolled in CSC454/2526 or have taken CSC454/2526 before to take this course.

There is also an application process on [the DCSIL website](https://www.dcsil.ca/student-courses).

## Communication

There are, just as you will find in a startup, various methods of communication. DCSIL has a private Slack group, which you will be expected to use. You will receive invites during the first week of the course. Likewise, Zoom will be used at points during this course. Please ensure you have it installed and signed into an account.

Communication, as we will discuss in the course, is vital to the success of any business. As your startup gains traction and becomes successful, you will find that communication methods and culture become a bottleneck within your company. As such, we will ensure students are exposed to different means of communication and include the following table to help you understand the various mediums.

| Medium | When to use |

| Email | TODO |
| Slack & Instant Messaging | TODO |
| In Person | TODO |
| Video Chat | TODO |
| Issues and tracking boards | TODO |
| Internal Wikis | TODO |
| Team Discussions | TODO |
