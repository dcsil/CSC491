## Your software

To help you keep on track, here are some general recommendations and guidelines on milestones and goals you should aim for throughout the term. While most of these aren't mandatory (unless enforced by assignments), following these will help ensure your success and avoid stress and chaos in the last 2 weeks of the course.

- You should start a skeleton hello world application as soon as you choose your base tech (Flask, Rails, iOS, etc)
- You should start building out a developer environment, CI setup, test infra, and production setup by the end of January
- You should start building out functionality no later than reading week
- Your models should also be started no later than reading week
- You should have demoable content by the first week of March
- You should have significant demoable content by March 11 (Assignment 6 deadline)
- You should be at the point of adding no new major features in the last week of March. This should be reserved for polish and bug fixes

## Demos

Here is an example of the progress I would expect for each demo slot:

- Demo 1: Decisions and Tech Stack, at minimum a Hello World application in your chosen language/platform
- Demo 2: You application running on CI, launched onto the web / mobile
- Demo 3: Minimal front end, mobile, and back end (as applicable). Starting code for any data models. Some functionality
- Demo 4: Full software, general functionality, note any shortcomings or areas to improve. Identify all main use cases implemented
