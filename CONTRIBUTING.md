This project is the course syllabus and outline for CSC491 (Capstone Design Project) at the University of Toronto.

I encourage all students, and even those outside the course, to submit issues and submit pull requests to change content.

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages uses Jekyll, though I intend to ensure the site is usable using Markdown only.

## Pull Request Process

1. Follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
1. All internal site links must be relative and include the `.md` link if it links to a markdown file. This is to make sure the markdown files are viewable on GitHub. Jekyll will automatically convert the links from .md for the website.
1. All pull requests must be approved by the course instructor (@jules2689), though any change to the assignments or grading scheme must be approved by the class after the semester has started.
1. All pull requests should render correct markdown and be checked for spelling errors. I suggest using Grammarly.com
