      <p><img src="/presentations/img/diversity/white_hand.jpg" alt="height:300px legend:White hand under soap dispenser" /></p>

<p>This is a soap dispenser. It dispenses soap without touching the dispenser.</p>

<p>Resitent bacteria can spread, despite the immediate hand washing, this prevents that. This is especially useful in hospitals.</p>

<p><strong>What an innovation!</strong> What is the problem with this?</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="its-racist">It’s racist!</h1>

<p>Well, it’s not racist, but it was clearly made by a team who <em>only tested it on light skin</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/presentations/img/diversity/black_hand.jpg" alt="height:300px legend:Black hand under soap dispenser" /></p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/presentations/img/diversity/spacesuit.jpg" alt="legend:Spacesuit height:400px" /></p>

<p>The space suit is an engineering marvel. Allowing a human to survive in the vacuum of space, it allows us to take a step where no man has gone before.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-only-men">Why only men?</h2>

<p><strong>Because space suits don’t fit women</strong></p>

<p><img src="/presentations/img/diversity/anne_mcclain.jpg" alt="legend:Anne McClain height:300px" /></p>

<p>Anne McClain is an astronaut that had to give up her seat on a mission into space because there was not enough space suits at NASA to fit <em>two</em> women at once.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>Workplaces that are not diverse &amp; inclusive can have detrimental effects on your products, create discriminatory environments, and have effects such as hand soap dispensers not working and career opportunities being suppressed (spacesuit incident).</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-1">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>On the other hand, they can literally <em>kill</em> people.</p>

<p>Let’s explore and discuss this topic in more depth.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-2">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Cars in the mid 20th century were designed for the 50th percentile of men. This means that cars were unsafe for women (and especially pregnant women).</p>

<hr />

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>It wasn’t until <strong>2011</strong> that companies started testing with female-sized crash test dummies. Many vehicles still aren’t as safe due to decades-established prejudist design practices.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-4">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>Other examples of potential problems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI being trained on men
    <ul>
      <li>AI robots used for operations in hospitals couldn’t respond to a woman’s voice</li>
      <li>Hello Barbie! barbie doll couldn’t respond to a child’s voice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Google’s Image labelling AI labelled black people as gorillas</li>
  <li>Apple Health Kit failed to include a feature for ~50% of the population until iOS 9… period tracking
    <ul>
      <li>They finally added it to Apple Watch in 2019</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-5">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>Other examples of potential problems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Youtube, when it first started, had an issue where 5-10% of their videos were uploaded upside down due to left handed users
    <ul>
      <li>Their team was mostly right-handed people</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the 1950s, Kodak developed a colour calibration card with a white woman
    <ul>
      <li>Took until the 1970s until the realized it had an impact on dark-skinned users</li>
      <li>Took until the 1990s to address the issue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-6">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>So why can’t we just train the people we have to understand these issues?</p>

<ul>
  <li>When white men were presented with a crowd of people that was 17% women, they thought it was an even 50/50 split
    <ul>
      <li>When it was 33% women, they thought it was majority female</li>
      <li>This is a good example of how it’s hard to sympathize and see another’s perspective</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-7">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>So why can’t we just train the people we have to understand these issues?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity outperform competitors by 15%
    <ul>
      <li>Companies with ethnic diversity outperform by 35%</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Studies have found that diverse work forces:
    <ul>
      <li>are 10x more effective</li>
      <li>are 9x more innovative</li>
      <li>provide 5x better customer service</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="diversity--inclusion-8">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h1>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multiple viewpoints lead to more innovations</li>
  <li>First hand experience is better than conceptual teachings, which leads to more culturally aware products</li>
</ul>
