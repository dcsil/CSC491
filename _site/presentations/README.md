### Attendance

While class attendance is mandatory, we will not be taking attendance.
This is a senior computer science class with a highly competitive application process.
As such, you are trusted to make the best choice for yourself and your team.

While there is no exam, keep in mind that we will be discussing topics relevant to your projects. If you miss a class, you will have to learn that material on your own and you will be expected to take it into account during the course of your project.

See the [Attendance Policy here](../policies/attendance.md).
