Assignment 4 - Dev Env, Test Infrastructure, & Production Setup
---

- You will be required to set up a developer environment, including a bootstrap script.
- You must set up a test infrastructure and a CI System. I recommend using GitHub Actions
- You must deploy a web app to a production environment. I highly suggest using DCSIL's Heroku Account
- It doesn't have to do much, you can deploy and test a Hello World app for now, if needed

# Initial Requirements

**TODO**

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. Please include the path location of the assignment within the release body.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.
