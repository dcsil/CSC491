# Option 3 and 4 - Bug Fix / Feature

In order to give you experience in contributing to other applications and to fix your own issues in the DCSIL team app, you can fix bugs and implement features yourselves.

Both are worth 2.5 - 5%, depending the severity of the bug and the complexity/need of the feature.

Features should first be cleared with the instructor to ensure that the feature is actually desired.

You can implement as many fixes and features as you want, but can only obtain up to 5% among all bonus assignments.
