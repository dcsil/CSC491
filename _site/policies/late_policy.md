Late Policy
---

Students are expected to work diligently to pass their assignments in on time. This course is intended to partially model a startup, however it is still a university course. Assignments also take time to mark and lecturers/TAs schedule their time according to the course calendar. We ask that you be respectful of their time by not passing assignments in late.

Assignments will be accepted up to 1 week past the due date at -5% per day.

| Days Late | Percent Lost |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | -5% |
| 2 | -10% |
| 3 | -15% |
| 4 | -20% |
| 5 | -25% |
| 6 | -30% |
| 7 | -35% |
| 8+ | -100% |

Accomodations may be made in cases of extenuating circumstances.
