    - section: Diversity
      description: |
        - Explain some areas, which you are comfortable sharing, where the team may lack diversity. You do not need to attribute statements to any individual team member, but you are welcome to do so if you are comfortable.
          - You do not need to feel pressured to share or pressure colleagues to disclose anything to the team or publicly, but for the dimensions folks are happy to share, it will give you the opportunity as a team to determine where you may have blind spots on your team.
          - Do not feel restrained by the subset listed above as there are many dimensions of diversity, visible and non-visible, that change how you experience the world.
          - Teams should aim to go beyond visible dimensions of diversity, though those should be included (e.g. gender, nationality, ethnicity).
        - Team gives thoughtful rhetoric on how these areas may impact their team and product
