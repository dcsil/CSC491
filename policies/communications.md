# Communication

There are, just as you will find in a startup, various methods of communication. Please hold group online discussions on Quercus or another tool of your choosing. You will receive invites during the first week of the course. Likewise, Zoom will be used at points during this course. Please ensure you have it installed and signed into an account.

Communication, as we will discuss in the course, is vital to the success of any business. As your startup gains traction and becomes successful, you will find that communication methods and culture become a bottleneck within your company. As such, we will ensure students are exposed to different means of communication and include the following table to help you understand the various mediums.

| Medium | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| Email | Private matters  |
| Quercus | Assignments, Grades for CSC491. Team Discussions can happen on the Quercus site for CSC454 |
| In Person | Hallway conversations. If you decide anything here, write it down somewhere else on your Team's GitHub Repo |
| Video Chat | For when you cannot attend class, need to discuss something and email doesnt provide enough human experience  |
| Issues and tracking boards | When you have a problem that needs to be fixed and are comfortable talking about it in the open |
| Internal Wikis | You can keep team docs here in GitHub, but I ask that you keep it in the repo for grading purposes |
| Team Discussions | You can use this feature on GitHub for casual, async updates |

** If you start a Slack or Discord group, or some other chat service, please let me know!
