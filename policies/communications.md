# Communication

There are, just as you will find in a startup, various methods of communication. DCSIL has a private Slack group, which you will be expected to use. You will receive invites during the first week of the course. Likewise, Zoom will be used at points during this course. Please ensure you have it installed and signed into an account.

Communication, as we will discuss in the course, is vital to the success of any business. As your startup gains traction and becomes successful, you will find that communication methods and culture become a bottleneck within your company. As such, we will ensure students are exposed to different means of communication and include the following table to help you understand the various mediums.
