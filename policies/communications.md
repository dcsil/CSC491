# Communication

There are, just as you will find in a startup, various methods of communication. Please hold group online discussions on Quercus or another tool of your choosing. You will receive invites during the first week of the course. Likewise, Zoom will be used at points during this course. Please ensure you have it installed and signed into an account.

Communication, as we will discuss in the course, is vital to the success of any business. As your startup gains traction and becomes successful, you will find that communication methods and culture become a bottleneck within your company. As such, we will ensure students are exposed to different means of communication and include the following table to help you understand the various mediums.

| Medium | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| DCSIL Team App | Creating teams. Assignment feedback, surveys, etc for CSC491/2600 |
| Slack | General discussions and questions. The instructor for CSC491/2600 (Julian Nadeau) also prefers this communication method. |
| Email | Private matters. The instructor for CSC454/2527 (Mario Grech) also prefers this communication method. |
| Quercus | CSC454/4527 uses Quercus |
| In Person | Hallway conversations. If you decide anything here, write it down somewhere else on your Team's GitHub Repo |
| Video Chat | For when you cannot attend class, need to discuss something and email doesnt provide enough human experience  |
| Issues and tracking boards | Team: Use this heavily as a decision record on most topics. Making use of GitHub Issues shows participation from all users (including non-technical) and will be a part of your grade in CSC454/2527<br> CSC491/2600: When you have a problem that needs to be fixed and are comfortable talking about it in the open |
| GitHub Releases | For your team repository, use this as a method to record assignment submission for CSC491/2600 |
| Internal Wikis | You can keep team docs in your team repo on GitHub. I ask that you avoid using the wiki feature as it makes grading more difficult |
