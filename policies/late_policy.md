Late Policy
---

Students are expected to work diligently to pass their assignments in on time. This course is intended to partially model a startup, however it is still a university course. Assignments also take time to mark and lecturers/TAs schedule their time according to the course calendar. We ask that you be respectful of their time by not passing assignments in late.

### Mark Deductions

Assignments will be accepted up to 5 days past the due date at -10% per day.

| Days Late | Percent Lost |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | -10% |
| 2 | -20% |
| 3 | -30% |
| 4 | -40% |
| 5 | -50% |
| 6+ | -100% |

NOTE: This policy is slightly different for synchronous demos. Please see that assignment for further details on the late policy.

### Asking for an Extension

- Accommodations can be made by talking to the instructor. They are not guaranteed, however, but we do like to model a startup so they usually are acceptable! :)
- Extensions that are requested within 6 hours of the due date will incur a penalty of 1 day, so please do not wait until the last minute to communicate with the instructor.

### Compounding assignments

These assignments are, generally, made to compound one another. While assignments may be late and you may lose 100% of the marks, you must still complete them to work on the following assignments.
