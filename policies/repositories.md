## Repositories

- We use the https://github.com/dcsil Github Organization
- You need to [create a team repo on Github](https://github.com/organizations/dcsil/repositories/new) using [this template](https://github.com/dcsil/Team-Repo-Template) for team notes, profiles, and other team metadata. This repo **is not for code**. You will lose 20% on each assignment where you submit code via this repo.
- You can create as many application repos (for code) as you need within <https://github.com/dcsil>
- Every repository must have a `service.yml` that _passes_ checks.
  - Every repository must therefore have logging, exception handling (via Sentry), a bootstrap script etc
