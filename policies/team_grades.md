Team Grades
---

When working in teams, students are expected to divide workload equitably. The nature of the division is
up to the team members, and does not require that all members work the same hours or produce
identical volumes of work. By default all team members receive an identical grade on team assignments.
Students should report any difficulties in their teams to a member of the Teaching Team as early as
possible so that the difficulties can be addressed in a positive way. Students should also maintain as
complete a record of team interactions as possible. Based on solicited, confidential feedback, or at the instructors discretion based on participation in the course - the Course
Instructor may adjust the grade distribution within a team.
