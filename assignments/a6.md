# Initial Requirements


1. Code
   - All code should be easily accessible in repos under the DCSIL organization
   - All repos should be linked to your team in the DCSIL Team App (**TODO** Add link to docs?)
2. It is required that the software be easily accessible:
   - If it is a web app, we should be able to visit a URL. Provide the teaching staff credentials with which to log in, if necessary
   - If it is a desktop app, we should be able to install it with the Mac/Windows Installer. We can support Mac and Windows applications, Linux-only applications will not be accepted.
   - If it is a mobile app, we should be able to install it with iOS/Android installer. We can support iOS and Android.
   - If your app, or part of your software, does not fit in one of the above categories, then please speak with the instructor before submission
   - **If your app is not easily accessible, then you will receive a 0% for the evaluation of the running software**
3. There should be tests. The tests should be sufficiently covering your code.
   - You must implement code coverage on your app and run it in CI. The code coverage must upload results as per [this guide](./code_coverage_guide.md). 
   - You must implement the code coverage uploading and code coverage in your CI.
4. There must be CI, Production, Exception Logging, and all requirements from A4.

**TODO**

# Submission

You will demo this in class to the instructor & TA

You must also [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo where the code is located.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. The body does not even need any content, just ensure it is there and appropriately labeled.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.

 - Email the course instructor or email the professor via the email on the homepage / README

# Rubric
 
| Area | Description| Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applications | All applications present in the architecture diagram have a repository and an MVP is implemented | 20.0 |
| Hosting and Builds | All applications are accessible via a Web URL, mobile release, or pre-packaged deployment (Mac 10.15 and Windows 10 supported) | 10.0 |
| Test coverage | Tests should cover at least 65% of your application and upload to the DCSIL Team App. | 20.0 |
| Operational Excellency | CI, Exceptions, Logging are all setup. Bootstrap script works. Service.yml is uploaded with no errors in the DCSIL team app | 15.0 |
| TBD | TBD | 35.0 |
| | **Total:** | 100.0 | 

### Notes

* If you have `n` parts of the app (e.g. frontend, backend, data pipeline, etc.), regardless of if they are in different repos or just different folders, each section will be worth `worth/n` for each part of the app.
* If your code is not under the DCSIL organization, it will be considered as non-existent. You will receive a 0 for that part of your codebase.
* If your application cannot be easily run and evaluated (hosted on an accessible URL, mobile app installable, desktop app installable, etc.), it will be considered incomplete and receive a 0 in `Hosting & Builds`
* If your application _is not_ uploading test coverage to codecov.io, it will be considered to have a coverage of 0%

## Rating Scale
