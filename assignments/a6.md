Assignment 6 - Demos
---

This assignment aims to get you to demo your progress throughout the term. In industry this is done to celebrate progress, so I'd like to do the same here.

You have 4 in-class demos. Attendance is mandatory or you will receive a 0 for that section unless extenuating circumstances arrive.

The demos should be (roughly) on these topics:

- Demo 1: Decisions and Tech Stack, at minimum a Hello World application in your chosen language/platform. Explain why you chose your techs, similar to the StackShare.io requirements in A3. How does this all support your product?
- Demo 2: Show your application running on CI, which means some basic tests (at minimum). Show us your test harness, what library did you choose, what troubles did you have? It should also be launched onto the web / mobile - show us. How does this all support your product?
- Demo 3: Minimal front end, mobile, and back end (as applicable). Starting code for any data models. Some functionality
- Demo 4: Full software, general functionality, note any shortcomings or areas to improve. Identify all main use cases implemented. Identify use cases to be completed.

Demos _do not_ need to be a high quality production. You can record your screen for a minute or 2, you can do it live, you can show us screen shots and discuss those... whatever you like. All we ask is that you show us progress.

# Initial Requirements

1. Demo is at least 2-3 minutes, but no more than 6 minutes
2. Demo shows progress
3. Demo is not a high quality with tons of production value behind it
4. Demo shows us a story

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. Please include the path location of the assignment within the release body.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.
