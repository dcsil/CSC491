Assignment 6 - Demos
---

This assignment aims to get you to demo your progress throughout the term. In industry this is done to celebrate progress, so I'd like to do the same here.

You have 4 in-class demos. Attendance is mandatory or you will receive a 0 for that section unless extenuating circumstances arrive.

The demos should be (roughly) on these topics:

- Demo 1: Decisions and Tech Stack, at minimum a Hello World application in your chosen language/platform. Explain why you chose your techs, similar to the Stack Decisions requirements in A3. How does this all support your product?
- Demo 2: Show your application running on CI, which means some basic tests (at minimum). Show us your test harness, what library did you choose, what troubles did you have?
- Demo 3: You will describe a particularly tough technical problem you are working on, the troubles you've faced, and how you solved/are solving them.
- Demo 4: Full software, general functionality, note any shortcomings or areas to improve. Identify all main use cases implemented. Identify use cases to be completed.

Demos _should not_ be a high quality production. You can record your screen for a minute or 2, you can do it live, you can show us screen shots and discuss those... whatever you like. All we ask is that you show us progress.

# Initial Requirements

1. Demo is at least 2-3 minutes, **but no more than 6 minutes** (you will lose marks if you can't tell your story in 6 minutes!)
2. Demo shows progress
3. Demo is not high quality with tons of production value behind it
4. Demo shows us a story

### Additional Notes

- Demos will happen at the **beginning of class**. Demo order will be chosen at random by randomly selecting from the team list using SQL's `ORDER BY RAND()` function. You must be present for all demos and you must be on time, no excuses or exceptions (other than those noted below) without talking to the instructor _before the class starts_.
- **Missing the demo**: A student who misses a demo for any reason without first talking to the instructor will lose 25% of the total mark (e.g. 1 of the 4 demos).
- **Late for the demo**: Demos are chosen in a random order. If you are not present for your team's time slot, your team will be pushed down the list. For each slot your team is pushed down the list, you will lose 10% of your mark for that demo (1/4 of all demo marks). If you miss 3 demos (about 15-20 minutes), you will be marked absent for that demo and forfeit the full 25% for that demo.
- **Exceptions**: The above applies to all reasons with the exception of family emergencies or health emergencies. Things like work, TTC, other classes having term tests, etc. are not valid reasons to be late or miss a demo as these situations can be avoided or are known in advance. If you are going to be late due to work, term tests in other classes, etc - you must speak to the instructor _before the class starts_. If you are sick, please notify the instructor before class starts.
