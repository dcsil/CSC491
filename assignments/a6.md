# Initial Requirements


1. Code
   - All code should be easily accessible in repos under the DCSIL organization
   - All repos should be linked to your team in the DCSIL Team App (**TODO** Add link to docs?)
2. It is required that the software be easily accessible:
   - If it is a web app, we should be able to visit a URL. Provide the teaching staff credentials with which to log in, if necessary
   - If it is a desktop app, we should be able to install it with the Mac/Windows Installer. We can support Mac and Windows applications, Linux-only applications will not be accepted.
   - If it is a mobile app, we should be able to install it with iOS/Android installer. We can support iOS and Android.
   - If your app, or part of your software, does not fit in one of the above categories, then please speak with the instructor before submission
   - **If your app is not easily accessible, then you will receive a 0% for the evaluation of the running software**
3. There should be tests. The tests should be sufficiently covering your code.
4. There must be CI, Production, Exception Logging, and all requirements from A4.

# Submission

You will demo this in class to the instructor & TA

You must also [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo where the code is located.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. The body does not even need any content, just ensure it is there and appropriately labeled.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.
