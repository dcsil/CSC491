# Option 1 - Blog Post

I believe in the value of good writing and sharing knowledge.

[dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a platform on which developers share knowledge, have discussions, and debate tons of development-related topics. There are also career topics and other related startup-related topics.

This option is to write a blog post on dev.to on a topic with which you have expertise.

You can write as many posts as you want, but can only obtain up to 2% among all bonus assignments.
