# Option 2 - Local Tech Meetup & Written Takeaways

I believe in the value of community, good writing and [contributing to the knowledge loop](https://www.getdbt.com/about-us/values). 

This option is to attend a (local) technology meetup or build day that focuses on software systems and/or practices, and to publish a short reflection on your experience and key takeaways. Some examples of prior events:
* https://www.meetup.com/toronto-modern-data/
* https://cohere.com/events/build-toronto

Reach out to Michelle prior to attending any event to vet their potential usefulness. Any meetup not approved by Michelle will not be valid for bonus assignment submission and will receive a 0%.

You can attend and write as many posts as you want, but can only obtain up to 2% among all bonus assignments.
