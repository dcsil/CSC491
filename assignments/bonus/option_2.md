# Option 2 - Security Vulnerability

Security is one of the most important aspects of software development. A single mistake can take down entire companies due to data leaks, unauthorized access, and more. This doesn't even account for the potential damage to the users of the software.

This assignment is to find a security vulnerability in the DCSIL Team App. **YOU MUST NOT:**

- Access any other students profile or data
- Assume the identity of another student

My user ID (for Julian Nadeau) is 49. You may use that profile if you wish to demonstrate a vulnerability.
