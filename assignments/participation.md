### Participation

Participation is an important aspect of this course. As the course is a very experience-based course, and we are mimicking a startup, it is important that everyone participates.

You are expected to be active in the following:

- GitHub Issues for your team
- Team Standups via the LearnSoftware app
- Contributing (commits and PRs) to the repositories your team creates (it doesn't have to be all of them if you make multiple!)
- Online Lectures Chat
- The DCSIL-hosted Slack
- Class discussions and general day-to-day operations
- Team meetings and other aspects of your team principles

It is _very_ important that you are meaningfully active on your team's GitHub repositories. If it is noticed that you are not participating at all, we'll have a talk to discuss the issue. If you do not correct for these actions, you may be subject to losing participation marks in CSC454/2527 as well.

Teams are required to enable and set up standups. CSC491 Students are required to answer the standups at least 8 of the 12 weeks, though they are recommended to answer every week for their team's benefit.

I am not expecting you to be super outgoing (I'm certainly not the most outgoing myself) but I do expect you to be actively participating when you can. If there are concerns, please let me know in private so we can discuss any issues. Nothing here should be a surprise for you at the end of the term.

Note that some of these can be easily tracked (GitHub issues, Pull Requests, commenting on lectures, Slack Messages) and some of this will be based on observations from the teaching staff. We will also be expecting that you provide a written paragraph summarizing your participation.
#### Requirements for Participation

- Students are required to set up their LearnSoftware profile including Resume & Ballot, Avatar, and other profile preferences by EOD January 14th
- Students make a demonstrable effort to join a team by EOD January 15th
- Teams are required to enable and set up standups. CSC491 Students are required to answer the standups at least 8 of the 12 weeks, though they are recommended to answer every week for their team's benefit.
  - Standups must include the questions "What did you work on since the last update?" and "What do you plan to work on next?"
- Students are required to check off all participation list items on https://learnsoftware.engineering/participation
- Students are required to comment on the "Participation" assignment on the Learn Software app. It must include a paragraph outlining:
  - An overview of the work they did for all team projects and assignments
  - An overview of work other CSC491/2600 students did for the CSC491/2600 assignments
  - A general sentiment if you think the work was split fairly

_This entry is private and only the teaching staff can see it_. Participation will be marked as 0 for all sections on which it is indicated below.

**Team Principles**

In assignment 1 you will create a principles document outlining how often your team will meet, how they prefer to communicate, and how they prefer to work. While this is a living document and expected to change slightly throughout the term (with approval from the rest of your team), you are still expected to uphold the various principles contained within. If your team doesn't see you at any meetings - for example - then you are not upholding your team principles.

 <!-- RUBRIC END -->

Please note that each section may not be split evenly between different aspects listed in that section. For example, you may have adequate issues made, but not have PRs submitted. You may be penalized more than 1/2 of that section's marks. This is up to the sole discretion of the instructor.

## Submission

You must submit a comment on the "Participation Assignment" in the LearnSoftware app by the final due date (11:59:59pm on the last day of class). This comment should explain how you participated and help me corroborate the work I see in GitHub, Slack, and Class.
