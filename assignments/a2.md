Assignment 2 - Team Exploration - Diversity and Inclusion
---

Your 2nd assignment will build directly off of your 1st assignment.

By now, you should be well acquainted with the theme of the startups for this course, as well as your team. Your second assignment will be to identify areas where your team has expertise and where it may lack expertise.

The intention of this assignment is to help you identify strengths and weaknesses of your team, explore your own unconscious bias, and evaluate the general diversity of your team. You will be expected to identify some potential bias your team may have given their life experiences and describe how these biases may impact the project. You will further be expected to identify where you need to bring in subject matter experts and where you could improve your team's diversity.

You will be expected to work together and submit this assignment as a team. Anyone can submit it, I suggest using an issue on the repo you're about to create to coordinate that submission.

[Example from a previous term](https://github.com/dcsil/klutch/blob/4f648f62a4a6a84d3fd87b92969584d288f0e0e2/team/diversity.md). (you should note this repo came from a previous iteration of this course, so some of the instruction was different. If you are unsure about something, err on the side of caution and use this term's instructions or ask me).

# Initial Requirements

1. Should be at least 1 page of writing, 12pt font, single spaced. Write as much as you feel is needed to accurately capture the rest of these requirements.
2. Identify where your team's backgrounds and expertise may benefit the project
3. Identify where your team's backgrounds and expertise are not enough for this project
4. Given (3), identify some subject matter experts you think would help fill this gap. Describe how.
5. Identify where your team may lack diversity and how this could affect the company, team, and product
7. Describe how people in other diverse groups benefit your team's vision

Note: **You will not be penalized for not being "diverse" enough. This is an exercise to explore diversity and identify how your team's backgrounds may impact your ability to empathize with customers, see ethical considerations, etc. There are _no_ diversity criteria**

# What is the purpose of this assignment?

This assignment works to help you get to know your team and dive into the topic of diversity and inclusion. This is a topic that is generally not covered in your undergrad, but it permeates our industry. It is hoped that through this assignment you learn about both diversity, as well as intersectional roles in order to be a more effective engineer.

We expect you to thoughtfully write and dive into these topics past surface level. We expect you to watch the lectures on this topic before submission in order to gain a better understanding of the topics.

We expect all members of your team, including CSC454/2527 students, to participate in this assignment.

# Diversity

Your "startup" is global. The moment you launch, your project is global. It will target groups and demographics around the world, it will (hopefully) hire people who aren't like you, it will grow as an collection of humans who are different. When your company lacks diversity, it stunts its own growth and contributes to toxicity in the industry.

Diversity is a very broad term and encompasses a lot of areas, both broad and niche. Some major areas of diversity include:

 - Gender Identity
 - Racial Identity
 - Sexual Orientation
 - Nationality
 - People with Disabilities
 - Immigrants
 - Religious Identity

There are a lot more niche and broad topics that we could discuss, but this subset is just to get you started. The notion here is that people with different combinations of life experiences will help identify how your product may or may not work for them, provide novel ideas, and help with conflict resolution in the workplace as people are more accommodating by workplace culture of others' differences, etc.

Keep in mind that we are not suggesting to selectively hire people based on their "diversity", but to understand that diversity can help you grow and you can take proactive steps to ensure a welcoming environment for diverse candidates and customers.
