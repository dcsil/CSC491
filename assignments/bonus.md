# Bonus Assignment

I believe in the value of good writing and sharing knowledge.

[dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a platform on which developers share knowledge, have discussions, and debate tons of development-related topics. There are also career topics and other related startup-related topics.

Your bonus assignment, worth 5% extra, is to write a blog post on dev.to on a topic with which you have expertise. This bonus can only be completed once per term.
