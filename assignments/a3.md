Assignment 3 - CUJ Runthrough + Demo
---

Your third assignment requires you to utilize another tool, documenting the process and your learnings.

Critical User Journeys (CUJs) are essential to document and test. While product documentation typically outlines the ideal path for using a product, the actual user experience often differs. This variation depends on factors such as the user's persona, their familiarity with the platform, and any integration work they may be undertaking.

For this assignment, you will define a specific goal you aimed to achieve with [TODO] and thoroughly document the end-to-end process of setting it up. Subsequently, you will summarize both the successes and areas for improvement, offering recommendations on how the experience could be enhanced. Finally, you will present these findings in a written document and a brief three-minute class presentation.
