Final Demo
---

Your final *live* demo will be to the entire class. You should present a functional demo of the product you built over the last few months. You will give a *live demo* of the product in class to the instructor & TA and take questions from everyone.

The goals of the demo are:

- present to everyone the problem you are solving
- give everyone a sense of the progress you've made
  - demonstrate your progress on what you've built so far
  - make a special effort to describe how your architecture and product plans changed over the term
- show *real working software*
- some content can be mockups to give extra context, the focus should be on the software

# Initial Requirements

The demo should include the following:

- Description of the problem you are trying to solve and your solution
- Live demo of the main flows you think are relevant to the solution
- Describe your build plan. Did you stay on schedule? If not, why? (This is fine as long as it's not _months_ behind schedule)
  - Include your architecture diagram, how did this change?
  - How did your product plans change over time?
- Pain points and unexpected problems

### It is okay if...

- some features are partially implemented
- there are minor bugs

# Submission

You will demo this in class to everyone.

You must also [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo where the code is located.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. The body does not even need any content, just ensure it is there and appropriately labeled.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.


# What is "Real Working Software" for the final demo?

This is a course designed to make a startup. When you're running a startup, you need all the help you can get. This means your software should be adequately automated. We will be looking for the following when determining if your software is "real" and "working".

- All requirements from A4 and A6 are complete (CI, testing, code coverage, development bootstrap script, etc.)
- All repo's READMEs have been kept up to date
  - The READMEs have been split up into a `docs` folder if it gets too big

## The Application

- The application runs
- The application does not throw exceptions on any standard path
  - Note, we recognize some non-standard paths in the code may cause some problems, but do your best to guard against exceptions
- The application has some sort of design system in place
- The application has progressed over the term and main features/functionality are complete and are relatively bug-free

# Questions or Concerns?

- I don't like part of this assignment
 - File an issue on this repo
- I need to clarify something about this assignment
 - File an issue on this repo
- I need to clarify a question or ask something in private
 - Email the course instructor or email the professor via the email on the homepage / README

# Rubric
 

| Area | Description| Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem and Solution | Gives a concise explanation of the problem and solution. | 5.0 |
| Product Vision | Explains the vision of the product, tells us about the future of the product, does not leave questions unanswered`**` | 15.0 |
| Demo | The demonstration covers the main flows of the application. The flows seem to address the problem and be a solution. | 25.0 |
| Software | Has working code that runs and delivers a demo. Does not need to use command line (unless that is the main product UI!), code, unit tests, or other mockups to show the main flow. Mockups can be used to show non-main-path or future plans.  | 25.0 |
| Reflection | Thoughtfully reflects on the build plan, architecture diagram, product, and problems faced. Describes how these changed over the term. Outlines plans into the future. Students incorporate the descriptions and problems, as well as future plans, into their demo to give the audience a visual understanding. | 15.0 |
| Presentation | Engaging presentation, ensures only relevant parts are shown and does not sugar-coat. Tells a good story. | 15.0 |
| | **Total** | 100.0 |

`**` It is ok to say "I'm not sure, thank you for bringing that up. I'll research it and get back to you" as long as it's not a large portion of the questions

## Rating Scale
