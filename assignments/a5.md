Assignment 5
---

This assignment should be completed alongside Assignment **TODO** in CSC454/2527. In that assignment, you will be expected to do user research with surveys. This extension to that assignment expects that you have some sort of paper or UI prototype of key functionality with which to engage potential users.

This research should provide you insights into how users work and gain valuable insights on your assumptions.

# Initial Requirements


1. User Research
    - Given the mockup in (2) and the persona you described in (3), find at least 2 "real" users* to test the product
    - Tell us how the user, in your opinion, matches the persona in (3)
    - Explain to the user what you want them to accomplish, not which parts of the UI to interact with
    - As they work to complete the task, take notes on anything that seems interesting, any mistakes they made, and any questions they ask. I recommend recording the conversation if possible.
    - Include any notes, questions, mistakes, and feedback from the user in the final submission as an appendix
    - Summarize how the research sessions went in the main report. Reference the notes if needed.
2. Roadmap
    - Given the research you performed, update the roadmap from your previous assignments in the repo. You should now have enough to give a more detailed roadmap.
    - The roadmap should now give a good sense of what you are planning, and should list goals on at least a monthly cadence, if not bi-weekly (given the short time frame of this course).



### It is okay if...

- some features are partially implemented
- there are some clearly unstyled parts (there should be some basic consistent style though!)
- there are minor bugs
- parts of the demo have to be executed via command line, unit tests, exploration of the code

# Submission

You will demo this in class to the instructor & TA

You must also [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo where the code is located.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. The body does not even need any content, just ensure it is there and appropriately labeled.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.

# Questions or Concerns?

- I don't like part of this assignment
 - File an issue on this repo
- I need to clarify something about this assignment
 - File an issue on this repo
- I need to clarify a question or ask something in private
 - Email the course instructor or email the professor via the email on the homepage / README

# Rubric
 
| Area | Description| Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Problem and Solution | Gives a concise explation of the problem and solution | 10.0 |
| Progress | Has clearly progressed. | 10.0 |
| Vision | Clearly shows and explains the vision of the product, does not leave questions unanswered`*` | 10.0 |
| Software | Has working code that runs and delivers a demo | 40.0 |
| Reflection | Thoughtfully reflects on the build plan and problems faced | 10.0 |
| Presentation | Engaging presentation, ensured only relevant parts were shown and does not sugar-coat | 20.0 |
| | **Total** | 100.0 |

`*` It is ok to say "I'm not sure, thank you for bringing that up. I'll research it and get back to you" as long as it's not a large portion of the questions
