Assignment 1
---
Your first assignment will be to create a private repository (repo) in the DCSIL organization that outlines your company.
This repo will act as your company's "homebase" and will contain design assets, company policies, marketing plans, etc.

       - Who are the main users in this market?
       - What is the opportunity cost?
       - _Important_: How does your team's expertise align with this market/opportunity. What expertise is your team missing?
5. Simple Roadmap
    - You have the duration of this course. Setup a basic roadmap that includes as much detail as you want with the following conditions:
       - Must include your immediate next steps
       - Must include plans to perform user research
       - Must include low-fidelity plans for a launch date
       - You fill in the gaps
       
**None of this information is set in stone. Provide a basic insight into your initial thought processes, change the repo as these insights evolve throughout the course**

# Why a repo?

While you may use a different medium in real-life, the intention in using a repo for this course is to allow you to _version control_ your content.
This will enable everyone to see the evolution of your company over time.

## How to use this repo throughout the course

This repo is your homebase. When you have a decision, log it. Make use of issues, wikis, and projects as you see fit.
**However, make sure you describe how your team works in the README and update it with new decisions**. Failure to describe this in the README will force me to try and figure it out myself and will result in a lower communications grade.

Let the process evolve over time. Reflect on your processes, change them, record them.

There are two exceptions:
 - You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to submit this assignment. More details in the [submission](#submission) section.
 - You must use pull requests to add content, with reviews from other team members

## Recommended uses

While you can work the way you want (except for the exceptions noted above), I've found this setup to be pretty useful for a "team repo":

| Area | Use |
| -- | -- |
| Issues | Track questions and product roadmaps. These make a great decision log |
| Project | Roadmapping |
| Pull Requests | When you don't like something, find an outdated line or link... change it using a PR. Tag others on your team to review. Aim for a 24-48H turn around on reviews for that. |
| Wiki | The repo itself is sort of like a wiki, see the CSC491 repo for an example |

This repository (for CSC491) will be setup like this, but may evolve over time.

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give me a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The body of the release must include a list of Pull Requests (at least one from every member) that has reviews.
