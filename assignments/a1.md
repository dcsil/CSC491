Assignment 1 - Team Introduction, Team Setup
---

The LearnSoftware App has created a blank repository in the DCSIL organization on GitHub for your team.

This repo will act as your company's "homebase" and will contain design assets, company policies, marketing plans, etc. This repository **should not contain your code. Please make new repositories in the DCSIL organization for your code from your team's profile on the LearnSoftware App.**

The intention of this assignment is to kickstart your company with a basic foundation and be a forcing function to get your team acquainted with each other. It will also see you form your "team principles", a short 1-page description of the communication styles/requirements and responsibilities of your team and members.

You will be expected to work together and submit this assignment as a team. Anyone can submit it, I suggest using an issue on the repo you're about to create to coordinate that submission (GitHub Issues are required to be created and used to coordinate work from _all_ teammates, including CSC454/2527 people).

[Example from a previous term](https://github.com/dcsil/klutch/tree/v1.0.0). Requirements may have changed since this example, so make sure to check the requirements for this assignment.

# Initial Requirements

Some of these initial requirements may be duplicated from CSC454/2527, you can use those materials. The repository must be set up like a **company not a course**. I do not want to see folders named "Assignment 1", etc. except for the GitHub Release in the submission.

1. Company name.
2. A first version of your logo.
3. Team Folder with profiles.
   - Include any relevant links to profiles or documents such as your GitHub profile, LinkedIn, Resume, Bio, Twitter profiles, etc
   - Be fun, write a small paragraph to help your teammates get to know you more
4. Team Principles
5. Leader election

# What is the purpose of this assignment?

This assingment works to help you get to know your team. The team principles specifically is in place to help your team work effectively and understand what "effective" means. This will be a living document and can change throughout the term.

We expect all members of your team, including CSC454/2527 students, to participate in this assignment.

# Why a repo?

While you may use a different medium in real-life, the intention in using a repo for this course is to allow you to _version control_ your content.
This will enable everyone to see the evolution of your company over time.

## How to use this repo throughout the course

This repo is your homebase. When you have a decision, log it. Make use of issues, wikis, and projects as you see fit.
**However, make sure you describe how your team uses various communication methods in either the README or the Team Principles and update it with new decisions**. Failure to describe this in the README will force the teaching staff to try and figure it out myself and will result in a lower communications grade.

Let the process evolve over time. Reflect on your processes, change them, record them.

There are two exceptions:
 - You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to submit this assignment. More details in the [submission](#submission) section.
 - You must use pull requests to add content, with reviews from other team members

## Recommended uses

While you can work the way you want (except for the exceptions noted above), I've found this setup to be pretty useful for a "team repo":

| Area | Use |
| -- | -- |
| Issues | Track questions and product roadmaps. These make a great decision log |
| Project | Roadmapping |
| Pull Requests | When you don't like something, find an outdated line or link... change it using a PR. Tag others on your team to review. Aim for a 24-48H turn around on reviews for that. |
| Wiki | While these can be helpful, please do not use them as they are hard to find for our apps and team management tools |
| In-Repo Docs | General documentation can be laid out in markdown files in a folder structure that makes sense |

This repository (for CSC491) will be setup like this, but may evolve over time.

## Leader Election

You will elect a "leader" in your team. This person will be responsible for making product and business decisions for the build and making sure the build stays on track. While this leader can be from either class, the person will be required to manage the CSC491/2600 side so it may make sense to make this "decision person" from the CSC491/2600 side.

In your submission, tell us who your "leader" is. Note: this person will potentially change throughout the term.

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo. This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it. See release body criteria and example below. Assignments without a coherent release body that follow the instructions in this assignment will be rejected and marked 1 day late. See release body criteria and example below. Assignments without a coherent release body that follow the instructions in this assignment will be rejected and marked 1 day late.

Second, you must submit the release on the LearnSoftware application. You can find the submission location here: <https://learnsoftware.engineering/my_assignments>

### Release Body

Release bodies must include:
- Direct links to all submitted files
- A paragraph explaining the progress your team has made, and contents of this assignment
- Any additional paragraphs described in the assignment
- Summaries of issues made by your team since last release
- Summaries of changes to your roadmap, architecture, or use cases (changes to use cases must be approved by the instructor).
