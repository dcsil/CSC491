Assignment 1
---
Your first assignment will be to create a private repository (repo) in the DCSIL organization that outlines your company.
This repo will act as your company's "homebase" and will contain design assets, company policies, marketing plans, etc.

The intention of this assignment is to kickstart your company with a basic foundation and be a forcing function to get your team acquainted with each other.

You will be expected to work together and submit this assignment as a team. Anyone can submit it, I suggest using an issue on the repo you're about to create to coordinate that submission.

# Initial Requirements

1. Company name and market.
2. A first version of your logo.
3. Team Folder with profiles.
   - Include any relevant links to profiles or documents such as your GitHub profile, LinkedIn, Resume, Bio, Twitter profiles, etc
   - Be fun, write a small paragraph to help your teammates get to know you more

# Why a repo?

While you may use a different medium in real-life, the intention in using a repo for this course is to allow you to _version control_ your content.
This will enable everyone to see the evolution of your company over time.

## How to use this repo throughout the course

This repo is your homebase. When you have a decision, log it. Make use of issues, wikis, and projects as you see fit.
**However, make sure you describe how your team works in the README and update it with new decisions**. Failure to describe this in the README will force me to try and figure it out myself and will result in a lower communications grade.

Let the process evolve over time. Reflect on your processes, change them, record them.

There are two exceptions:
 - You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to submit this assignment. More details in the [submission](#submission) section.
 - You must use pull requests to add content, with reviews from other team members

## Recommended uses

While you can work the way you want (except for the exceptions noted above), I've found this setup to be pretty useful for a "team repo":

| Area | Use |
| -- | -- |
| Issues | Track questions and product roadmaps. These make a great decision log |
| Project | Roadmapping |
| Pull Requests | When you don't like something, find an outdated line or link... change it using a PR. Tag others on your team to review. Aim for a 24-48H turn around on reviews for that. |
| Wiki | The repo itself is sort of like a wiki, see the CSC491 repo for an example |

This repository (for CSC491) will be setup like this, but may evolve over time.

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The body of the release must include a list of Pull Requests (at least one from every member) that has reviews.
