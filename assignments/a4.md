Assignment 4 - Dev Env, Test Infrastructure, & Production Setup
---

This assignment aims to get you set up with best practices in which to build your software. Below are high level goals, followed by in detail requirements.

- You will be required to set up a developer environment, including a bootstrap script.
- You must set up a test infrastructure and a CI System. I recommend using GitHub Actions
- You must deploy a web app to a production environment.
  - Please add the instructor and TA to your application so we can see it running if needed. You can remove us after the semester is over.
  - Our emails are available on the Learn Software app in our profiles.
- It doesn't have to do much, you can deploy and test a Hello World app for now, if needed

# Initial Requirements

1. You have created a `service.yml` file in the top directory of your repo. This will help us, and others, see everything available to run and use in your repo.

    <details style="margin-bottom: 1em" markdown="1"><div class="details-box">

    ```yaml 
    tools:
      exceptions: https://...
      logging: https://...
      ci: https://...

    services:
      production: https://...
      production_dashboard: https://
      staging: ...

    docs:
      getting_started: https://...
      
    commands:
      bootstrap: script/bootstrap
      database:
        create: bin/rails db:create
        migrate: bin/rails db:migrate
      server: bin/rails server
    ```

    This should serve as an example. These kinds of files can help you debug, record links to docs, services, tools, and more.

    While this is less useful with one app, in an organization with many apps this can be crucial to remembering and finding information.

    <h4>Examples:</h4>

    - [F2019 Team Klutch - Javascript](https://github.com/dcsil/klutch/blob/master/app/service.yml)
    - [Team App - Rails/Ruby](https://github.com/dcsil/team_app/blob/master/service.yml)

    </div></details>

2. You have a `script/bootstrap` script, `bin/bootstrap` script, or similar, available and able to be run on Unix systems (Sorry Windows Users).
  - This should install dependencies if needed like Postgres, MySQL, Redis, etc
  - This should install any languages required
  - This should install any packages like Rubygems, Node Packages, etc
  - Docker Compose or Docker is ok to use

    <details style="margin-bottom: 1em" markdown="1"><div class="details-box">

      Write a script named `script/bootstrap`, it should setup much of your system for you.

      It is fine if the script targets one operating system (mac, linux, or windows).
      
      Make note of this script in the README of your app. If you have a getting started guide, this can be in there but you should make sure that that guide is mentioned in the README.
      
      Docker and Docker Compose is a good option here

      <h4>Examples:</h4>

      - [Javascript and Node](https://github.com/integrations/jira/blob/master/script/bootstrap)
        - this uses `brew bundle`, which comes from https://brew.sh/
        - `brew bundle` installed everything from the [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/integrations/jira/blob/master/Brewfile)
      - [Ruby and Rails, Team App](https://github.com/dcsil/team_app/blob/master/bin/bootstrap)
        - this uses some custom install scripts to try and minimally impact the system
        - it installs all languages, dependencies, and databases that it needs
        - then it creates and migrates the database so it's ready to use

    </div></details>

3. You have a test infrastructure set up and listed in your `service.yml`. You should be able to run _exactly_ what you list in your `service.yml` file to run your tests. It is ok if you only test a `hello world` app for now.
4. You have CI setup to run your tests from (3).


    <details style="margin-bottom: 1em" markdown="1"><div class="details-box">

      I recommend [GitHub Actions CI](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions).

      <h4>Examples:</h4>

      - [Javascript example for GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/integrations/jira/pull/295)
      - [Node example for GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/dcsil/klutch/blob/master/.github/workflows/nodejs.yml)
      - [Ionic example for GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/dcsil/klutch/blob/master/.github/workflows/ionic.yml)
      - [Ruby example for GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/dcsil/team_app/blob/master/.github/workflows/ruby.yml)

    </div></details>

5. You must have your app available online (if a web app) via a public URL. If you are not making a web app, you must have your app available via a compiled artifact in a GitHub Release for the teaching staff to install. We should *not* have to do anything than open the install file.

    <details style="margin-bottom: 1em" markdown="1"><div class="details-box">

      You can deploy to Heroku really easily with Ruby, Javascript, Python, Go, PHP, and other languages.
        - You only need the hobby dyno
        - I would recommend Postgres as there is a free hobby database you can use
        - This is not good to host your machine learning experiments
        - It is included in your [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

      - [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are other options and also included

    </div></details>

6. You must record any decisions, changes, and updates to your StackShare Stack and update your Architecture diagram from A3.

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. Please include the path location of the assignment within the release body.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.

# Rubric
 
<!-- RUBRIC START --> 

| Section | Description | Worth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service.yml` | Is present and fully filled out | 10.0 |
| `script/bootstrap` or similar | Functions fully on Unix systems. Application is fully ready to run after running the script (dependencies installed, database install and setup, etc). The only exception is when you need to get credentials for something like a 3rd party API, that can be a different step. | 30.0 |
| Testing and CI setup | Test harness works and can be run from a single command listed in the service.yml file. CI is running and is passing. | 25.0 |
| Production / Builds | Application is available from the web, or a GitHub Release if it's not a web app | 25.0 |
| Roadmap | Roadmap and Stackshare.io are updated with any new decisions and/or changes | 10.0 |
| | **Total:** | 100 |
