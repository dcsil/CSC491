Assignment 4
---

Your fourth assignment will provide us with a semi-functional demo of the product you planned in Assignment 3. You will give a *live demo* of the product in class to the instructor & TA and take questions from the instructor & TA.

The goals of the demo are:

- give the instructor & TA a good sense of the final product
- demonstrate your progress on what you've built so far
- show you're making progress towards your MVP
- show *real working software*
- some content can be mockups to give extra context, the focus should be on the software

# Initial Requirements

The demo should include the following:

- Description of the problem you are trying to solve
- Description of your solution
- Live demo of the main flows you think are relevant to the solution
- Describe your build plan. Did you stay on schedule? If not, why? (This is fine as long as it's not _months_ behind schedule)
- Pain points and unexpected problems

### It is okay if...

- some features are partially implemented
- there are some clearly unstyled parts (there should be some basic consistent style though!)
- there are minor bugs
- parts of the demo have to be executed via command line, unit tests, exploration of the code

# Submission

You will demo this in class to the instructor & TA

You must also [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo where the code is located.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. The body does not even need any content, just ensure it is there and appropriately labeled.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.

# Rubric

| Problem and Solution | Gives a concise explation of the problem and solution | 10.0 |
| Progress | Has clearly progressed. | 10.0 |

| Reflection | Thoughtfully reflects on the build plan and problems faced | 10.0 |
| Presentation | Engaging presentation, ensured only relevant parts were shown and does not sugar-coat | 20.0 |
| | **Total** | 100.0 |

`*` It is ok to say "I'm not sure, thank you for bringing that up. I'll research it and get back to you" as long as it's not a large portion of the questions
