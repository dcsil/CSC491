Assignment 4 - Dev Env, Test Infrastructure, & Production Setup
---

- You will be required to set up a developer environment, including a bootstrap script.
- You must set up a test infrastructure and a CI System. I recommend using GitHub Actions
- You must deploy a web app to a production environment. I highly suggest using DCSIL's Heroku Account
- It doesn't have to do much, you can deploy and test a Hello World app for now, if needed

# Initial Requirements

1. Problem & Solution 
  - Concisely describe the problem you are trying to solve and the solution you've developed
2. Low Fidelity mockups
  - Create a low fidelity mockup/prototype in the medium of your choice (paper, Sketch diagram, Photoshop, etc). This should not be restrictive and should not include any written code.
3. User Persona
  - Develop a user persona. This is your target market.
  - Describe the persona you've chosen and tell us how they are impacted by the problem in (1)
  - Given the mockup in (2), describe how the user persona would use it to solve the problem in (1)
4. User Research
  - Given the mockup in (2) and the persona you described in (3), find at least 2 "real" users`*` to test the product
  - Tell us how the user, in your opinion, matches the persona in (3)
  - Explain to the user what you want them to accomplish, not which parts of the UI to interact with
  - As they work to complete the task, take notes on anything that seems interesting, any mistakes they made, and any questions they ask. I recommend recording the conversation if possible.
  - Include any notes, questions, mistakes, and feedback from the user in the final submission as an appendix
  - Summarize how the research sessions went in the main report. Reference the notes if needed.
5. Research Thoughts
  - Given the problem in (1), the mockup in (2), and the research in (4), does the solution you suggested actually work?
  - How can the mockup be improved?
6. Build Plan
  - Given the research you performed, update the roadmap from Assignment 1 in the repo. You should now have enough to give a more detailed roadmap.
  - The roadmap should now give a good sense of what you are planning, and should list goals on at least a monthly cadence, if not bi-weekly (given the short time frame of this course).


`* real user can be subjective here. You may not have access to real users, so you can choose the closest match possible`

# Submission

You must [create a release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) on your repo.
This will give us a snapshot in time and allow us to grade it.

The release does not need to include pull requests or commits from every member. Please include the path location of the assignment within the release body.

It is suggested to use a folder and multiple files, just like this CSC491 repo, to contain this assignment.
