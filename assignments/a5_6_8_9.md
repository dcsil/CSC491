Assignment 5,6,8,9 - Demos
---

Throughout this course you will do a total of 4 progress demos. These demos are to showcase your incremental development process and decision making. This is an exercise often seen in industry, and you should be able to show off what youâ€™re doing without much prep. Insights through the course will maybe make you pivot what your building, how you build it, to create a great product. 

We expect all CSC491/2600 students to actively participate.

Attendance is mandatory or you will receive a 0 for that section unless extenuating circumstances arrive.


The demos should be (roughly) on these topics:

* **Demo 1: Decisions and Tech Stack**  
  * Present a "Hello World" application in your chosen language/platform.  
  * Explain the customer journey (CUJ) you plan to build and justify your technology choices, explaining how they support your product.  
* **Demo 2: CI and Testing**  
  * Show your application running on a continuous integration (CI) system, including basic tests.  
  * Describe your test harness, the testing library you selected, and any challenges you encountered.  
* **Demo 3: Technical Problem Solving**  
  * Detail a particularly difficult technical problem you've faced.  
  * Discuss the challenges encountered and how you resolved or are resolving them.  
* **Demo 4: General Functionality and Future Scope**  
  * Demonstrate the main implemented use cases of your application.  
  * Identify any shortcomings or areas for improvement.  
  * List the remaining use cases to be completed.

Demos _should not_ be a high quality production. You can record your screen for a minute or 2, you can do it live, you can show us screen shots and discuss those... whatever you like. All we ask is that you show us progress.

# Requirements

* in-class demo and must be submitted synchronously in class.  
  * Demo is at least 2-3 minutes, but no more than 6 minutes (you will lose marks if you canâ€™t tell your story in 6 minutes\!)  
  * Demo shows progress  
  * Demo is not high quality with tons of production value behind it  
  * Demo shows us a story  
  * You should share any new research that is informing the direction of your project.  
* Github release  
  * Link to github release in Quercus.

## Release Body

Should be between 400-800 words. Your submission must include:

* Direct links to all submitted files.  
* **Roadmap Update:**  
  * A paragraph detailing your team's progress and the contents of this assignment.  
  * Summaries of issues created by your team since the last release.  
  * Summaries of any changes made to your roadmap, architecture, or use cases (changes to use cases require instructor approval).  
* **Roadmap Change Details:**  
  * Architecture  
  * UI/UX  
  * Research  
  * Decisions Log  
  * Milestone Update  
  * Jobs to be done (JTBD)  
  * *Note: While you may not have changes in all these areas during a single release period, you should typically update at least three components. If you do not have three components to update, please consult your instructor for approval.*  
* **User Research**  
  * At minimum, two of your releases should include user research.  
  * Your reach should look like a light weight CUJ documenting how a user used your project and feedback and learnings from that experience.  
  * The â€˜userâ€™ you test with can be a classmate, instructure, friend, family member, etc.   
  * The â€˜userâ€™ **cannot** be a member of your team.

### Additional Notes

- Demos will happen at the **beginning of class**. Demo order will be chosen at random by randomly. You must be present for all demos and you must be on time, no excuses or exceptions (other than those noted below) without talking to the instructor _before the class starts_.
- **Missing the demo**: A student who misses a demo for any reason without first talking to the instructor will lose 25% of the total mark (e.g. 1 of the 4 demos).
- **Late for the demo**: Demos are chosen in a random order. If you are not present for your team's time slot, your team will be pushed down the list. For each slot your team is pushed down the list, you will lose 10% of your mark for that demo (1/4 of all demo marks). If you miss 3 demos (about 15-20 minutes), you will be marked absent for that demo and forfeit the full 25% for that demo.
- **Exceptions**: The above applies to all reasons with the exception of family emergencies or health emergencies. Things like work, TTC, other classes having term tests, etc. are not valid reasons to be late or miss a demo as these situations can be avoided or are known in advance. If you are going to be late due to work, term tests in other classes, etc - you must speak to the instructor _before the class starts_. If you are sick, please notify the instructor before class starts.
