Assignment 7 - Competitive CUJ
---

It's important to understand your competition. Similar to A3, for this CUJ you will try to use a competitor's tool and document the end to end process. You can later use this CUJ in your competitive analysis.

For this assignment, identify a competitor tool that aims to achieve the same or a similar objective as your project. If a direct competitor isn't available, describe the common processes users undertake to complete the "job to be done" (JTBD) your project addresses.

You will document the end-to-end process of setting it up. Subsequently, you will summarize both the successes and areas for improvement, offering recommendations on how the experience could be enhanced. You will also compare this experience to your own product. Finally, you will present these findings in a written document and a brief three-minute class presentation.

**Deliverables**
* Critical User Journey Document - 80 Points
* Submit a PDF version of the document on Quercus.
* In-Person Presentation (3 minutes) - 20 Points
* One group member will present to the class.
* All group members should be prepared to answer questions.
