### Important Notes

- Due dates can be seen on [the schedule](../other_pages/schedule.md).
- Each assignment builds off of one another. If you don't do one, you won't be able to complete the next assignment as it's rubric and requirements build off the ones prior to it.

### Participation

While there is no explicit mark for participation, you are expected to be active in the group discussions (usually on the course Quercus site), team chats, class discussions, and general day-to-day operations. If it is noticed that you are not participating at all, we'll have a talk to dicuss the issue. If you do not correct for these actions, you may be subject to up to a 10% penalty on your final grade.

I am not expecting you to be super outgoing (I'm certainly not the most outgoing myself) but I do expect you to be actively participating when you can. If there are concerns, please let me know in private so we can discuss any issues.
