There are a number of assignments that make up your final grade, the weights are listed below:

<!-- OVERVIEW START -->
| Assignment | Description | Weight | Submission Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Assignment 1](/assignments/a1.md)  | A1 - Team Introduction, Team Setup | 8% | repo |
| [Assignment 2](/assignments/a2.md)  | A2 - Team Exploration - Diversity and Inclusion | 10% | repo |
| [Assignment 3](/assignments/a3.md)  | A3 - Tech Choices, Architecture Diagram, Roadmap | 10% | repo |
| [Assignment 4](/assignments/a4.md)  | A4 - Dev Env, Test Infrastructure, & Production Setup | 10% | repo |
| [Assignment 5](/assignments/a5.md)  | A5 - UX Research w/Prototype, Roadmap Updates | 8% | repo |
| [Software](/assignments/a6.md)  | Software | 45% | repo |
| [Participation](/assignments/README.md)  | Participation | 9% | N/A |
| [Bonus Assignment](/assignments/bonus.md) (Bonus) | Bonus Assignment | 5% | Dev.To |
| | **Total** | 100% (+5%) | |

<!-- OVERVIEW END -->

### Important Notes

- Due dates can be seen on [the schedule](../other_pages/schedule.md).
- Each assignment builds off of one another. If you don't do one, you won't be able to complete the next assignment as it's rubric and requirements build off the ones prior to it.

### Participation

While there is no explicit mark for participation, you are expected to be active in the group discussions, team chats, class discussions, and general day-to-day operations. It is _very_ important that you are meaningfully active on your team's GitHub repositories. If it is noticed that you are not participating at all, we'll have a talk to dicuss the issue. If you do not correct for these actions, you may be subject to up to a 10% penalty on your final grade.

I am not expecting you to be super outgoing (I'm certainly not the most outgoing myself) but I do expect you to be actively participating when you can. If there are concerns, please let me know in private so we can discuss any issues.

### Why are the grades weighted like this?

The whole point of this course is to write software. We aren't building an algorithm or standalone data structure - and leetcode is pretty useless in real day-to-day software development (sorry "cracking the coding interview"). To reflect this, the majority of your grade is reflected in your software deliverable.

Software, however, is not just made up of the code you throw into some files. It takes a team, infrastructure, and product work to build up something that works _well_. To reflect this, the other half of your grade is made up of various topics like team building, technology choices, infrastructure, and roadmapping. If you do not do well on this part, you will have a hard time truly succeeding in delivering a good software product.

- It is important that your team sets itself up for success. This is why we will start with team introductions, setup, and agreements. This will require input from those who aren't in CSC491, just like how real-life engineering work is interdisciplinary.
- I believe that diversity and inclusion in a team, and understanding your own biases, make for a better team and a better product. That is why we are devoting an assignment and lecture to the topic.
- You will see a lot of UX and product management-style work in much of the course (roadmapping, UX work, etc). You can throw together some code, but you need a coherent plan to execute an idea.
- Lastly, software is great but unless you have solid foundations (developer environments, testing, and production) then you will have issues early on in your startup's success. That is why we devote a lot of time to this topic as well.
