### Participation

While there is no explicit mark for participation, you are expected to be active in the Slack group, team chats, class discussions, and general day-to-day operations. If it is noticed that you are not participating at all, we'll have a talk to dicuss the issue. If you do not correct for these actions, you may be subject to up to a 10% penalty on your final grade.

I am not expecting you to be super outgoing (I'm certainly not the most outgoing myself) but I do expect you to be actively participating when you can. If there are concerns, please let me know in private so we can discuss any issues.
